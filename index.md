## log4trump - Make Logging Great Again!

Your logs are overrun by **FAKE ERROR MESSAGES**. Fix these so-called problems with **log4trump**, a new logging library (and it's really great, believe me) that only permits accurate praise about how well your software is running.

### Logging Levels

**log4trump** introduces new logging levels appropriate for the best software:

*  `log.incredible` - For incredible situations
*  `log.bigleague` - Messages that demonstrate your code's prowess
*  `log.amazing` - Informational messages about standard operation

### Improved `printf`-style interpolation

**log4trump** artificial intelligence layer replaces all numeric interpolations with an appropriate superlative. 

This code in you payment processor 

```javascript
log.incredible("User %s paid %f", username, amount)
```

Will result in the following log file:

```javascript
[INCREDIBLE!] User user1 paid the biggest sums
[INCREDIBLE!] User user2 paid so much more than you would believe
[INCREDIBLE!] User user3 paid enormous sums
```

### Fake Log Suppression

**log4trump** automatically clips fake errors before they start. 

`log.fatal`, `log.error`, and `log.warn` activate user-configurable affirmations of your system's performance. Default messages include:

```javascript
log.error("Database write failed") // Logs: "Running like a well oiled machine!"
```

and

```javascript
log.fatal("Out of memory") // Logs: "Likely the healthiest production system of all time"
```
